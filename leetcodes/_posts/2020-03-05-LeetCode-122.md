- **Title**: #122 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
- **Diffculity**: Easy 
- **Description**: Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day $$i$$.
Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).\
- **Notes**: 
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

- **Explanation**: \
因為要找出最大化的profit，限制連買、連賣，必須買進且賣出後才能再買入。\
定義一個profit變數；若當天比前一天價格還高，便計算價差並累加profit。


Solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        for (int j=1; j<prices.length; j++){
            if (prices[j] > prices[j-1]){
                profit += prices[j] - prices[j-1];
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
```
- Time&Space Complexity: $$O(n), O(1)$$


Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: 'List[int]') -> 'int':
        profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            profit += max(0, prices[i] - prices[i - 1])
        return profit
    break
```
- Time&Space Complexity: $$O(n), O(1)$$
