# [#997 Find the Town Judge](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/) ![Leetcode](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-Leetcode-green.svg) ![Leetcode](https://img.shields.io/badge/WeekTwo-MayChallange-red.svg)

- **Description**: In a town, there are N people labelled from 1 to N.  
    There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
    If the town judge exists, then:
    1. The town judge trusts nobody.
    2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
    3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
    You are given trust, an array of pairs trust[i] = [a, b] representing that the person labelled a trusts the person labelled b.
    If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the town judge.  Otherwise, return -1.  

- **Chinese Translation**: under construction... 

- Given: N -> int, trust -> list[list[int]]
- Return: Town judge # -> int
- Resolution: 
- Example:

```
Input: N = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
```

- Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, N: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if N == 1:
            return 1
        
        score = [0 for _ in range(N+1)]
        
        for a, b in trust:
            score[a] -= 1
            score[b] += 1
        
        for i in score[1:]:
            if i == N-1:
                return score.index(i)
        return -1
```
