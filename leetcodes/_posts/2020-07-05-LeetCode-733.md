# [#733 Flood Fill](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/) ![Leetcode](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-Leetcode-green.svg) ![Leetcode](https://img.shields.io/badge/WeekTwo-MayChallange-red.svg)

- **Description**: An image is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing the pixel value of the image (from 0 to 65535).

    Given a coordinate (sr, sc) representing the starting pixel (row and column) of the flood fill, and a pixel value newColor, "flood fill" the image.

    To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, 
    plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on. 
    Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.

    At the end, return the modified image.

    1.  The length of image and image[0] will be in the range [1, 50].
    2. The given starting pixel will satisfy 0 <= sr < image.length and 0 <= sc < image[0].length.
    3. The value of each color in image[i][j] and newColor will be an integer in [0, 65535].
     
- Given: image -> list[list[int]]
- Return: modified image -> list[list[int]]
- Resolution: This is 4-way search. dfs() will check the coordinate is valid? not visited? not colored? if yes, colored this coordinate and recursively run other coordinates aroud current pixel, if not return nothing and jump out of the recursion.  
- Example:

```
Input: 
image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
Explanation: 
From the center of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels connected 
by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected
to the starting pixel.
```

- Code:

```python

    def floodFill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, newColor: int) -> List[List[int]]:

        h, w = len(image), len(image[0])

        def dfs( r, c, src_color, new_color):
            
            if (r < 0) or (c < 0) or (r >= h) or (c >= w) or ((r,c) in visited) or (image[r][c] != src_color):
                # Reject for invalid coordination, repeated traversal, or different color
                return
            
            # update color
            image[r][c] = new_color
            
            # mark current coordination as visited
            visited.add( (r,c) )
            
            # DFS to 4-connected neighbors
            dfs( r-1, c, src_color, new_color )
            dfs( r+1, c, src_color, new_color )
            dfs( r, c-1, src_color, new_color )
            dfs( r, c+1, src_color, new_color )
            pass
        
        dfs(sr, sc, src_color = image[sr][sc], new_color = newColor)
        
        return image
```

- TODO
```python
add BFS method
```
