<ul>
  <li><strong>Description</strong>: Given two sorted integer arrays <script type="math/tex">nums1</script> and <script type="math/tex">nums2</script>, merge <script type="math/tex">nums2</script> into <script type="math/tex">nums1</script> as one sorted array. <br />
The number of elements initialized in <script type="math/tex">nums1</script> and <script type="math/tex">nums2</script> are m and n respectively.
You may assume that <script type="math/tex">nums1</script> has enough space (size that is greater or equal to <script type="math/tex">m + n</script>) to hold additional elements from <script type="math/tex">nums2</script>.</li>
</ul>
