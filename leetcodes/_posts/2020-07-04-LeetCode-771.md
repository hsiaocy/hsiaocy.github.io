# [#771 Jewels and Stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/) ![Leetcode](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-Leetcode-green.svg) ![Leetcode](https://img.shields.io/badge/WeekOne-MayChallange-red.svg)

- **Description**: You're given strings **J** representing the types of stones that are jewels, and **S** representing the stones you have. 
    Each character in **S** is a type of stone you have. 
    You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
    The letters in **J** are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in **J** and **S** are letters.
    Letters are case sensitive, so **"a"** is considered a different type of stone from **"A"**.  

- **Chinese Translation: 薩諾濕被婦愁者聯盟霸凌之際！
    他眼前出現了幻燈片。
    是小時候公園玩沙之際意外在旁邊看到寶石堆(J)和石堆(S)。
    貪婪的薩諾斯確認他拿了所有的寶石。
    因此開始比對石堆裡是否有遺漏的寶石（奇怪？今年不是五倍嗎？）...
    聰明你的能夠幫助薩諾濕順利度過奈何橋嗎？

- Given: J -> str, S -> str
- Return: How many jewels found in stones -> int
- Resolution: Count J and S, and sum up values(counts in jewels) by specific key (existed in both jewels and stones)
- 絲路: 計數J和S，累加石堆裡key同為寶石key的數。
- Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J: str, S: str) -> int:
        from collections import Counter
        je = Counter(J)
        st = Counter(S)
        res = 0
        for i in je:
            if st.get(i):
                res += st.get(i)
        return res
```
